                <h2>Pac-Man</h2>
                <p>This is the classic game, Pac-man. The object of the game is to get PAC-MAN to eat up all the dots in the maze without getting caught by the ghosts! 
                    Use the arrow keys to move PAC-MAN around the maze to start collecting dots to earn points. Watch out for the ghosts, PAC-MAN loses a turn every time you get caught by one.</p>

                <h2>Space Invaders</h2>
                <p>Shoot the invaders with your laser base while avoiding their shots and preventing an invasion. 
                    Amassing a high score is a further objective and one that must be prioritised against your continued survival. 
                    Each game screen starts with five rows of invaders. 
                    The bottom two rows score ten points per large invader, the middle two rows twenty points for each medium invader and the top row scores thirty points for each small invader. 
                    The score for each screen can be dramatically increased by the tactical destruction of the 'mystery' value spaceships that frequently fly from one side of the screen to the other. 
                    Temporary sanctuary can be sought beneath the 4 base shelters.</p>

                <h2>Donkey Kong</h2>
                <p>Mario has to work his way up the ladders and sloping girders in the first level of play. 
                    Donkey Kong rolls barrels down at you to keep you away. 
                    You can jump over the barrels or use the magic hammer to bash the barrels and pick up a few extra points. 
                    Level two has elevators to deal with (donâ€™t fall off), and Level Three has girders that must be unbolted to send Donkey Kong for a tumble. 
                    Run and jump for your life and go for that top score.</p>

                <h2>Pinball</h2>
                <p>To play pinball, you use flippers to control a ball on a tilted playfield, aiming to hit various targets and score points by keeping the ball in play as long as possible, 
                    preventing it from dropping through the bottom gap between the flippers while strategically bouncing it off different obstacles and ramps on the playfield; 
                    the goal is to achieve the highest score before all your balls drain. </p>

                <h2>Tetris</h2>
                <p>In Tetris, you must arrange a sequence of small shapes, called Tetriminos, into complete lines. 
                    As each line is completed, it will disappear from the screen. Tetriminos fall from the top of the matrix to the bottom. 
                    Each Tetrimino is made up of four blocks, arranged into seven different patterns.</p>

            <div class="angry-birds_text">
                <h2>Angry Birds</h2>
                <p>Players use a physical slingshot mechanism to launch different colored birds at structures built by pigs, 
                    aiming to destroy the structures and eliminate all the pigs on the screen by strategically hitting them with the birds, 
                    with the goal of achieving the highest score by completing each level with the fewest birds possible.</p>
